Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering

Aug. 2023 – May 2027
GPA: 3.93/4.00

Relevant Coursework: Computer Organization & Design (ECE411), Computer Systems Engineering (ECE391), Applied Parallel
Programming (ECE408), Digital Systems Laboratory (ECE385), Sensors and Instrumentation (ECE437)

Projects
MeOoOw – Out-of-Order Execution Processor | SystemVerilog, Computer Architecture & Microarchitecture
Sept 2025 – Present
• Design and implement a superscalar Out-of-Order (OoO) RISC processor featuring explicit register renaming, dynamic scheduling, and
reorder buffer (ROB) for high IPC and efficient instruction-level parallelism
• Verified individual components through directed tests and constrained-random verification in SystemVerilog, leveraging the Synopsys
toolchain for simulation, synthesis, waveform analysis, and timing closure
GPT-2 Inference Acceleration using CUDA | CUDA, GPU Acceleration, Deep Learning Systems
Sept 2025 – Present
• Implement and optimize custom CUDA kernels for GPT-2 inference, applying various GPU optimizations such as shared memory
tiling, memory coalescing, warp-level parallelism, and Tensor Core acceleration to achieve substantial speedups over CPU baselines
• Conduct detailed system-level and kernel-level profiling using NVIDIA Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute, identifying performance
bottlenecks, memory stalls, and occupancy issues to guide iterative kernel optimization
• Analyze GPU memory hierarchies, occupancy, and execution divergence, gaining deep insight into transformer model performance
characteristics on modern GPUs
CosmOS - Operating System from scratch | C, Operating Systems & Systems Programming
Jul 2025 – Aug 2025
• Collaborated in a team of three to develop core OS subsystems, including interrupt handling, user-level threading, and
kernel/application paging, inspired by Unix Version 6
• Implemented a custom, block-based filesystem with full CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete) and a caching system for
improved I/O performance
• Built virtual memory management using the RISC-V Sv39 paging scheme, with lazy allocation and page fault handling to optimize
memory utilization and process isolation
Music Synthesizer with Playback on FPGA | SystemVerilog, C, FPGA Design & Implementation
Apr 2025 – May 2025
• Designed and implemented a real-time music synthesizer and playback system on FPGA, supporting multi-track composition and
HDMI-based visual feedback
• Developed a custom embedded architecture utilizing BRAM to store multi-track note data, integrating keyboard input and on-screen
note visualization to enable synchronized playback and an interactive, real-time composition experience
• Verified correct functionality using the Xilinx Vivado waveform viewer and hardware logic analyzers, ensuring valid BRAM access,
accurate HDMI timing, and glitch-free audio output

Experience
UIUC Chen Lab

Feb 2025 – Sept 2025
Undergraduate Research Assistant
Urbana, IL
• Contributed to the expansion of ScaleHLS, an MLIR-based high-level synthesis (HLS) framework, by integrating Dafny for formal
verification to improve correctness and reliability in hardware design workflows
• Implemented computational kernels and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly in Dafny to explore verified hardware synthesis
• Collaborated with lab members through weekly meetings, slide presentations, and technical discussions to align research directions and
communicate progress effectively

ShotHawk

June 2025 – Aug 2025
Embedded Systems Intern
Urbana, IL
• Optimized the reliability and scalability of NVIDIA Jetson–based embedded devices by automating React application startup and
crash recovery with shell scripts, reducing manual setup and improving system robustness in field deployments
• Collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline deployment workflows and support the company’s transition from a minimally
viable product to a market-ready solution
